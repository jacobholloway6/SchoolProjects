# SchoolProjects
All Previously worked on assignments from past semesters


Each Project represents a data structure that I have worked on with to better my understanding of the algorithms. 
Below are the different algorithms implemented within the projects

Projects 1-4 are from my Data Structures and Algorithms class 

1. Linear algorithm with implementation of for loop containing O(N) elements.
2. Implementaion of a Stack with runtime complexity of O(1)
3. Utilizing a BST with complexity of O(logN)
4. Implementing a shortest path algorithm that has a runtime complexity of O(N^2) given that it uses a  recursive DFS search method. 

Previous Java Labs are coding projects that I worked on from Spring Semester of 2022 they consist of the following items. 

1. Game Grid - which is a game where the user will attempt to get to the far right or bottom right of the grid that is not visible to the user.
2. Drone Service - Utilizes an on device server that is running apache tomcat and allows for a user to go to a webpage and create a grid and then run the      drone along that grid that was created.
