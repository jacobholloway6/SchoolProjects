# SchoolProjects
All Previously worked on assignments from past semesters


Each Project represents a data structure that I have worked on with to better my understanding of the algorithms. 
Below are the different algorithms implemented within the projects

1. Linear algorithm with implementation of for loop containing O(N) elements.
2. Implementaion of a Stack with runtime complexity of O(1)
3. Utilizing a BST with complexity of O(logN)
4. Implementing a shortest path algorithm that has a runtime complexity of O(N^2) given that it uses a  recursive DFS search method.
